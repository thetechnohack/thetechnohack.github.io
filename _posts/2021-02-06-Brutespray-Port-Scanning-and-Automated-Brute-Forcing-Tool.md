# Brutespray
BruteSpray is an open source python tool which provides a combination of both port scanning and automated brute force attacks against scanned services.

It takes the **GNMAP/XML** output from an Nmap scan and automatically brute forces the services running with default credentials using Medusa or use your dictionary to gain access.

# Installing Brutespray
> Download the `.zip` file from GitHub and install it manually.

Or

> Run the following command to install `brutespray` package on Kali:

```bash
$ apt install brutespray
```

The following screenshot shows the output of the preceding command:

> Once it is installed, we can run the tool with the -h flag to view the list of all features and help.

```bash
$ brutespray -h
```

The following screenshot shows the output of the preceding help command:

# How to do it...
We are doing this in 2 steps :
- Scanning Target

- Brute Forcing Targeted Services

## Scanning Target :
> First of all we need a target device.

> Here I'm using my own virtual machine as a target (IP: 192.168.1.5)

> So, let's scan this target using Nmap to find out which services are running.

```bash
$ nmap 192.168.1.5
```

In the following screenshot you can see running services on the targeted victims device:

> Now we need to save this Nmap output as an <ins>XML or GNMAP</ins> file.

> We are saving the Nmap output as an XML file on our desktop using the following command:

```bash
$ nmap 192.168.1.5 -oX /root/Desktop/scan.xml
```

You can see how this command looks alike:

> Now we can see that there is a file created on our desktop as **scan.xml**.

## Brute Forcing Targeted Services :

> To run a default brute force on all of the services that were discovered by a previously run Nmap scan, we can use the following command:

```bash
$ brutespray --file scan.xml --threads 5
```

The preceding command looks like this:

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/morphy/image/upload/v1612603222/brutespray/brutespray_command_e7xzts.png)

> To run the tool on one particular service, we can use the -s flag and
define the service we want to perform a brute force attack on. In the
following example, we will use the Nmap scan that was done on a host
and only check the default credentials on the FTP service:

```bash
$ brutespray --file scan.xml -t 5 -s ftp
```

The following screenshot shows the output of the preceding
command:

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/morphy/image/upload/v1612603445/brutespray/scanning_ftp_mgmjkn.jpg)

> In the screenshot, we can see that the FTP allows anonymous
login, which is why the tool gave a success output for the credentials that
were shown.

> You can also use your custom user and password list to brute force.
For that you have to use -U and -P flag.

```bash
$ brutespray --file scan.xml -U username.txt -P passwords.txt -t 5 -s ftp
```
